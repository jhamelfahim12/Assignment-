    <h3>Nemassi Hegoue Jhamel Fahim</h3>
    <p>I am in the Biomedical Engineering program. I am a young, brilliant, bold, and chill guy from <b>Cameroon</b>, interested in machines and electronic components. I asked myself how these machines and electronic components are related to hospitals and how they can be useful to ill persons and deficient ones. That was one of the primary reasons why I have chosen Biomedical Engineering, and I always imagine myself working in hospitals. For now, I will strive and give my all in this program.</p>
