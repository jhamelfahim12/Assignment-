    <p>I am in the Biomedical Engineering program.I am a young,brillant,bold and chill guy from <b>Cameroon</b>,interested about machines and electronic components,I asked myself how are these machines and electronic components are related to hospitals and how it can be useful to ill personnes and deficient ones.
      That was one of the primary reason why I have choosed Biomedical Engineering and also I always imagine myself working in hospitals.
      For now I will strive and give my for in this program  .</p>
